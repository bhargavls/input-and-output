Input format:
Input consist of n+1 integers
First integer corresponds to the size of the list
Next n inputs corresponds to the elements in the list 
Output format: 
Output is an integer list
Sample Input
4 
1
2
3
4
Output
[1, 2, 3, 4]

4)Write a Python Program to put the even and odd elements in a list into two different lists.
Input format:
Input consists of one integer and one list.
First input consists of the size of the list.
Second input consists of the elements based on the size.
Output format:
Output consists of two lists.
First list consists of all the even numbers in the list.
Second list consists of all the odd numbers in the list.
Sample Input:
5
1
2
3
6
5
Sample Output:
The even list [2, 6]
The odd list [1, 3, 5]
5)Write a program to find the sum of the elements in the array. 
Input Format: 
Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the number of elements in the array.
The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers correspond to the elements in the array.
Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20. 
Output Format: 
Output consists of a double value which corresponds to the mean of the array.
Refer sample input and output for formatting specifications.

5
2
4
1
3
1
Sample Output:
11

Second inputs corresponds to the size of the list.
Output consists of the largest element.
Sample Input:
5
1
2
3
6
5
Sample Output:
1


7)Write a Program to find the search element in the given list
Input & Output Format:
Input consists of one list and one integer.

Input Format:
First line of input consists of our list elements.
Second line of input consists of value to count.
Output Format:
Print thr number of times the given value is repeated in the list.
Sample Input:
10 20 10 40 10
10
Sample Output:
3
